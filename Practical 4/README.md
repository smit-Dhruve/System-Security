# Study of Brute Force Attack & A Program to Create a Virus

### Brute Force Attack
A brute force method is a method where a set of predefined values are used to crack a password 

until successful. This is basically a “hit and try” method. This method might take a long time if the 

set of values are high, but its success rate is high.



This python-based brute force tool is created in a such a way that it can break any kind of password (only smallcase) with no limitation on the length of the password. Remember the longer the password the more time it will take to break it

#### Sample output
```
Enter your password : SMIT 
Bruteforcing your password: 
Your password is :  SMIT
```

### Virus
A computer virus is a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software. 

Computer viruses aim to disrupt systems, cause major operational issues, and result in data loss and leakage. A key thing to know about computer viruses is that they are designed to spread across programs and systems. Computer viruses typically attach to an executable host file, which results in their viral codes executing when a file is opened. The code then spreads from the document or software it is attached to via networks, drives, file-sharing programs, or infected email attachments.


Create your target folder - this is the folder you want your virus to attack.

For demonstration purposes, I have created a folder called Test under the C Drive.

```
C:\Test
```
This virus would create an endless number of text files which contains a different number in the text document each time.
